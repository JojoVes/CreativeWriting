Ash - "What do you want?"

Brothel Owner - "Oh I want what any woman wants: power."

"And what, pray tell, does that have to do with me?"

"Well, you, my wonderfully wistful wench, are my ticket to owning the most profitable brothel in town!"

"Ah... Is this that business with the new Queen?"

"Who got to you first? I'll pay double!"

"I was offered land, servants, and a title, just for being on call for appointments with the Queen and no other patrons."

"That's NONSENSE! No brothel in town can grant land and titles."

"Oh I wasn't approached by a brothel, I was approached by the Queen herself. It seems she prefers not to trust brothels, too much chatter. And given that she prefers blonds, and I'm the only blond in these parts, she hired me herself."

"The Queen...raising a slave to a land owner and her personal wench... There goes that chance at Royal coin..."

"Oh I think you made your fair share of Royal coin off the late King (rest his soul if he had one.)"

"And I shall make more Royal coin when you prove to be too boring for one such as the Queen. The girls I have from her region are the most skilled of any, so doubtless she is accustomed to more than what you have to offer."

"What if I prove more skilled? What if I take even the lords and ladies from your beds, for everyone knows the lords and ladies prefer your beds to their own homely abodes."

"Hah! Shows what you know about the preferences of the rich. They get rather picky about having their type, so unless you can change your skin, shape, and hair at will, I doubt most of my patrons would even look at you."

"It isn't me they need to look at. I was just musing about opening my own brothel. I'll have the land after all, and the land has a hot spring..."

"You don't know the first thing about running a brothel. Don't get all high and mighty for being a glorified whore. You're the Queen's pet and nothing more!"

Queen - "Hello Ash! Did everything go as planned?"

Ash - "Yes, Your Grace."

"She took the bait and gave you reason to start a brothel of your own?"

"Yes, though I confess I'm not quite sure why that conflict had to happen in a crowd. Why couldn't we start a brothel without all that noise?"

"...In time, you will learn to scheme like the highborn court of snakes we must navigate. You had a conflict in front of a crowd so there would be witnesses to your personal reasoning to starting a brothel, leaving me out of it, and providing some publicity for your new brothel. People are always interested in the new shiny things that appear around them, so people will be on the lookout now that you have announced your up-and-coming brothel--...what was that smirk about?"

"My appologies, Your Grace...it's just...Might I name the brothel--uh--'Up & Cumming'?"

"Ooo that is rather catchy, and people love a good chuckle. Quite versatile. Keep that name in mind and we can discuss it later... Do you still wish to hear my reasoning behind your conflict earlier?"

"Yes, sorry for interrupting Your Grace."

"Right, so now the stage is set for you to open a brothel and no one will suspect that I put you up to it. People tend to be skeptical of Queens who wish to open brothels."

"If I may ask, why do you want to open a brothel?"

"That does not concern you at the moment... Just consider it a playful hobby of mine."

***

Queen (thinking aloud to no one) "'A playful hobby' indeed...As if searching for the child stolen from my womb is a bloody hobby. I never even got to learn the sex of the poor child. All I get are letters from time to time from God-knows-who, stringing me along on some dream of retrieving my child..."

(Go on to talk about the Queen being from the south, and rumors about her owning a brothel because the lords swear fealty to the king, but the official business is of no interest to her. She wants to here about the whispers between the sheets, because that's where the real power is: the everyday little moments. If you can shape those, then you can shape a life. And she's using the network of brothels to find someone, a long lost daughter? Someone to be an heir to the throne she left.)
