Why do I fight what brings me joy?
Too afraid to dive in and be rejected by my passions.
Rejection at a desk job is much more simple than if someone's disinterest in my soul meant homelessness in my future.
Benefits,
Salary,
Stability.
The ability,
To plan for tomorrows...
I program my life
 as if I am a computer,
And I feel conflicted every time my human limitations keep me from following the meticulously laid instructions from my past self.
Later that night I right more instructions to discourage me tomorrow.
All so that someday I might make time for joy.
