Every line a poem  
Between each and every dot.  
Every poem a piece  
Of a larger work of art.  
Every piece a person  
Wandering through life.  
Every person walks a line  
Twisting, turning, rolling dice.  
Every line a poem  
Between each and every dot.  

Each line a poem  
On the grandmother's face.  
Each line a story  
On the surgeon's gloves.  
Each line a plea  
On the teen's thighs and arms.  
Each line a statement,  
A refusal to conform.  
Each line a warning  
To the next to do them harm.  
Each line a lesson  
Honing warriors into weapons.  
Each line a plan  
On the little newborn's hand.  
Each line a poem  
We refuse to read.
