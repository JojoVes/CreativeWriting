I guess I need to write something.
A million seeds of ideas float through my foggy brain:
Sexuality,
Creativity,
Coziness,
Playful cats,
Anxiety,
Depression,
Taboo topics,
Gratitude...

Nothing stays.
Nothing solidifies.
When I grasp an idea
In my mind's eye,
It dissolves
Before I can even write a draft.

But this is something.
This feeling of cluelessness
Grasping at anything that can make the journey
From my mind to the keyboard.

This is something,
And sometimes that's all that matters.
