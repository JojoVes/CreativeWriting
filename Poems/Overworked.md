Can't get the energy I need  
to play my part in this machine,  
and the perscription for that  
is caffeine.

Can't get through the day without it.  
Something's in my way without it.  
Feels like I'm drowning.  
My headache is pounding.  
The perscription for that  
is caffiene.

We're treating the symptom  
and ignoring the cause.  
It's the society we live in  
that's inherently flawed!

Work more.  
Sleep less.  
No time for weakness.  
Hurry up.  
Drink this.  
Just shut up like all the rest.  
'Til you work yourself to death.  
Drugging yourself,  
mumbling,  
and now you can't stop  
wondering  
why wash down all this pain  
with so many cups  
of caffeine.
