Every line a poem
Between each and every dot.
Every poem a piece
Of a larger work of art.
Every piece a person
Wandering through life.
Every person walks a line
Twisting, turning, rolling dice.
Every line a poem
Between each and every dot.

Each line a poem
On the grandmother's face.
Each line a story
On the surgeon's bloody hands.
Each line a plea
On the teen's thighs, wrists, and arms.
Each line a statement
Of defiance to conform.
Each line a warning
To the next to do them harm.
Each line a lesson
Honing soldiers into weapons.
Each line a plan
On the little newborn's hand.
Each line a poem
We refuse to read.
