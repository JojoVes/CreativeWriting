When The Emptiness takes over,
Nothing can fill that void...

...Nothing but time...

Waiting for Joy,
Not knowing what that is.

Waiting for Motivation,
Wondering how to care
About things like leaving bed,
Going to class,
Doing homework,
Cleaning,
Hobbies,
Living...

...Waiting...

I suppose
This is where wisdom goes.
Some solution to the problems in my head.
Sorry to disappoint,
But depression is not Art
To be tied
With a pretty bow.

Depression is a mess.
A mess of nothingness
Emptiness
Broken
Nightmares
Jagged edges
Of thoughts
Desperate to be stitched together
To form some meaning
To make the emptiness worthwhile...
To be tied
With a pretty bow.
