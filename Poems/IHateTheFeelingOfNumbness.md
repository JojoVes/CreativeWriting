I hate the feeling of numbness.  
Needle pricks and emptiness  
Someone please make sense of this  
Why do I crave pain over nothingness?

I hate the feeling of numbness.  
People wanting something  
I cannot give.

I know the words:  
Joy,  
Sadness,  
Anger,  
Fear--  
But their essence is gone.  

I remember having  
Motivation,  
Ambition,  
And living with intentions.  
So full of--

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what?


I hate the feeling of numbness.  
The absence of what ought to be  
Making me think longingly--

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what?

I can't even remember.
