I shouldn't miss you,  
and,  
most of the time,  
I don't.

Except when my brain assaults me  
with unwanted memories  
that drive me to my knees  
thinking dear God PLEASE  
let   it   go.

I shouldn't miss you,  
but it's hard to forget  
how your eyes drank my heart  
even as you said  
we could not be  
'us'  
.

I shouldn't miss you  
because I have someone  
who's better  
for me.  
Someone who will not leave me.  
Someone who works through  
life with me  
as a team.

I shouldn't miss you,  
but first loves stick around,
like the memory of exactly how to draw the pattern engraved in your necklace you gave to me after our first dance.

I shouldn't miss you,  
but sometimes  
I do.

I shouldn't miss you,  
but when I do  
the most nagging question  
I cannot ask is:  
Do you miss me sometimes too,
like when you look at your necklace,
if you still have it?

Maybe  
I just fear being forgotten  
by someone who was my rock  
for two years of my teenage life.  

Maybe  
missing you is my way  
of remembering  
how you helped me grow.

Maybe  
I'm still healing  
after six years.

You see,  
I have made progress:  
although I do miss you,  
most of the time I don't.
