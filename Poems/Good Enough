I'm not good enough. When I've spent most of my life being taught how to be better, I can't blame my brain for summarizing that as "I'm not good enough." When I spent five years in a Music degree, where I was expected to practice at least three hours a day, where I spent at least one hour a week getting one-on-one criticism that focused on how to get better rather than wasting time on praise for the improvements I made, I can't blame my brain for summarizing that as "I'm not good enough." When I look in the mirror and see a body that needs to be stronger and thinner with clearer skin, I can't blame my brain. I'm just not good enough. When I make a stupid mistake. When I can't make time to clean and work and study and socialize. When I can't win the soul-sucking energy-draining piece-of-shit chemical war in my head. What the fuck does "good enough" even mean? People should be constantly striving to better themselves, so when do we become "good enough"? Where is the goal? Maybe, the act of choosing to grow by using our faults to guide our improvement, maybe that's good enough.
