I suppose
This page is where wisdom goes.
Some solution to the problems in my head.
Sorry to disappoint,
But depression is not Art
To be tied
With a pretty bow.

When The Emptiness takes over,
Nothing can fill that void.

    Nothing 
            but
                time.



Waiting for Joy,
Not knowing what that is.

Waiting for Motivation,
Wondering how to care
About things like leaving bed,
Going to class,
Going to work,
Doing homework,
Cleaning,
Hobbies,
Living.


        Waiting



Depression is a mess.
A mess of
Nothingness
Emptiness
Broken
Nightmares
Jagged edges
Of thoughts
Desperate to be stitched together
To form some meaning
To make the emptiness worthwhile.
To be tied
With a pretty bow.
