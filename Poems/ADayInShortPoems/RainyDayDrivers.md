Walking home  
On a miserably rainy day.  
My gratitude goes out  
To considerate drivers.  

A strong "fuck you"  
flashes in my head  
for the one who splashed water  
into my boot.  
A stronger "fuck you"  
almost escaped my lips  
for the one who drenched me  
from head to toe,  
because  
they could not find the sense  
to s l o w  d o w n.
