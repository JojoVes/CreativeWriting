I shouldn't miss you,
and,
most of the time,
I don't.

Except when my brain assaults me
with unwanted memories
that drive me to my knees
thinking dear God PLEASE

let   it   go.

I shouldn't miss you,
but it's hard to forget
how your eyes drank my heart
even as you said
we could not be 'us'.

I shouldn't miss you
because I have someone
who is better
for me.
Someone who will not leave me.
Someone who works through
life with me,
as a team.

I shouldn't miss you,
but first loves stick around.

I shouldn't miss you,
but sometimes
I do.

I shouldn't miss you,
but when I do
the most nagging question
I cannot ask is:
Do you miss me sometimes too?

Maybe
I just fear being forgotten
by someone who was my rock
for two years of my teenage life.

Maybe
missing you is my way
of remembering
how you helped me grow.

Maybe
I'm still healing
after six years.
You see,
I have made progress;
Although I do miss you,
most of the time I don't.
