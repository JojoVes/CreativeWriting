I hate the feeling of numbness.
The absence of what ought to be
Making me think longingly
Of feelings I can't even remember.

I hate the feeling of numbness.
Needle pricks and emptiness
Someone please make sense of this
Why do I crave pain over nothingness?

I hate the feeling of numbness.
People wanting something
I cannot give.

I know the words:
Joy,
Sadness,
Anger,
Fear--
But their essence is gone.
Motivation,
Ambition,
Living with intentions
So full of ...
Of what?
