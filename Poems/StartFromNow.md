Maybe you woke up too late.
Maybe you could not summon the energy to get up from the table after breakfast.
Maybe you spend the afternoon distracting yourself from what you actually need to get done.

Start from now.

Have compassion; forgive yourself for taking that break, and getting that sleep you needed.
Do what you can to move forward, instead of drowning in your perceived past failures.
Turn your day around.
