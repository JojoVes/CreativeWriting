I'm not good enough.  
When I've spent most of my life being taught  
to be better,  
I can't blame my brain  
for summarizing that as  
"I'm not good enough."

When I spent five years in a Music degree,  
expected to practice at least three hours a day,  
and spent at least one hour a week  
getting one-on-one criticism  
focused on how to get better  
rather than wasting time  
on praise for the improvements I made,  
I can't blame my brain for summarizing that as  
"I'm not good enough."

When I look in the mirror  
and see a body that needs to be stronger  
and thinner with clearer skin,  
I can't blame my brain.  
I'm just not good enough.  

When I make a stupid mistake.  

When I can't make time to clean and work and study and socialize.

When I can't win  
the soul-sucking  
Energy-draining  
Piece-of-shit  
chemical war in my head.

What the fuck does "good enough" even mean?

Maybe the act of choosing  
to grow,  
by using our faults to guide our improvement,  
maybe that's  
good enough.
