Why do I fight  
what brings me joy?

Too afraid  
to dive in and be rejected by my passions.  
A desk job  
is much more simple  
than depending on peoples' interest in my soul.  
Benefits,  
Salary,  
Stability.  
The ability,  
to plan for tomorrows.

I program my life as if I am a computer,  
and feel conflicted every time  
my human limitations keep me from following the meticulous instructions  
from my past self.  
Later tonight I will write more instructions  
to discourage me tomorrow.

All  
so that someday I might make time  
for what brings me joy.
