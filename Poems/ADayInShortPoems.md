<b>Premature Grief</b>  
Sands of time slipping,  
and you find yourself missing  
that which is not gone.

<b>Leaf</b>  
Freshly fallen,  
not yet trampled.  
Shine while you can.

<b>Rainy Day Drivers</b>  
Walking home  
On a miserably rainy day.  
My gratitude goes out  
To considerate drivers.  

"Trip on your lead foot"  
flashes in my head  
for the one who splashed water  
into my boot.  

Many profane quips  
almost escaped my lips  
to drip  
down my face  
with the repulsive road river,  
because one driver  
could not find the sense  
to  s l o w  d o w n.
