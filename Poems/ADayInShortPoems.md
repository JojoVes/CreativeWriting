<b>Premature Grief</b>  
Sands of time slipping,  
and you find yourself missing  
that which is not gone.

<b>Leaf</b>  
Freshly fallen,  
not yet trampled.  
Shine while you can.

<b>Rainy Day Drivers</b>  
Walking home  
On a miserably rainy day.  
My gratitude goes out  
To considerate drivers.  

A strong "fuck you"  
flashes in my head  
for the one who splashed water  
into my boot.  
A stronger "fuck you"  
almost escaped my lips  
for the one who drenched me  
from head to toe,  
because  
they could not find the sense  
to s l o w  d o w n.
